You, as the \"parent\" account, can see the results and profile information for all sub-accounts you create, and can create and edit results on their behalf. Sub-accounts, however, cannot see or access the parent account or other sub-accounts under the parent account. Sub-accounts can have the same email address as the parent account, or a unique one, but an email address is required. If a sub-account has the same email address as the parent account, both the parent and sub-account user will use that email address to log in, and will be presented with a menu to choose what account they want to log into.
