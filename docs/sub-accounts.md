  <p>A sub-account is a separate user account that is linked to your main account (the one you're currently logged in to). Once you create a sub-account, the user of that account can log in on its own and enter/edit results and profile information.</p>
  <p>After creating a sub-account, you will need to share the password with the sub-account user. The sub-account user can use that password to login and create a new one if desired.</p>
  <p>You, as the "parent" account, can see the results and profile information for all sub-accounts you create, and can create and edit results on their behalf.</p>
  <p>Sub-accounts, however, cannot see or access the parent account or other sub-accounts under the parent account.</p>
  <p>Sub-accounts can have the same email address as the parent account, or a unique one, but an email address is required.</p>
  <p>If a sub-account has the same email address as the parent account, both the parent and sub-account user will use that email address to log in, and will be presented with a menu to choose what account they want to log into.</p>
